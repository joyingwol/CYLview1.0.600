# CYLview 1.0.600 (Windows) – Archived Distribution

This repository provides an **archived Windows distribution of CYLview version 1.0.600**.

It exists as a mirror for users affected by the failure of the legacy update mechanism in older CYLview releases.

---

## Platform

- **Windows only**
- Linux and macOS versions are **not included**

---

## Background

Older CYLview versions are no longer able to check for updates due to server-side changes.  
The official update endpoint now returns **HTTP 403 Forbidden**, causing update checks to fail.

CYLview v1.0.600 does not rely on the obsolete update mechanism and can be used directly.

A brief technical discussion is documented here (zh-CN):
